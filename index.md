I am a computer science major at CSUF. This is my first year. I plan to graduate by 2028.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs 

*Lab 2, part1

This is one of my favorite labs because it was one of the easiest to 
understand when the semester just began. The instructions were clear 
and when I would get lost I would go back to lab 2 to get reminded of what to do.

*Lab 6, part1

I liked this lab because the instructions were clear and I understood 
most of it. I too liked it because it was very enjoyable with my lab partner.
I liked that concept that they gave us for that lab. It was also one of the labs
that made me understand.

*Lab 12, part1

This is one of my favorite labs because it was the most interactive 
and creative one so far where we can actually see results and how they look. 
Reflected in the colors and images that were supposed to be at the end. 
I also liked this lab because it was the easiest with my partner.
