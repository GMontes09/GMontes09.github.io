### Favorite CPSC 120L Labs 

*Lab 2, part1

This is one of my favorite labs because it was one of the easiest to 
understand  and very straightforward when the semester just began. The instructions were clear and when I would get lost I would go back to lab 2 to get reminded of what to do.
The lab instructor was very helpful and it gave me somewhat confidence. We were just begging to learn the basics of Github and linux commands.

*Lab 6, part1

I liked this lab because the instructions were clear and I understood 
most of it. I too liked it because it was very enjoyable with my lab partner.
I liked that concept that they gave us for that lab. It was also one of the labs
that made me understand. We were learning how to use "std::vector<std::string>type"
and how to use what if statements.

*Lab 12, part1

This is one of my favorite labs because it was the most interactive 
and creative one so far where we can actually see results and how they look. 
Reflected in the colors and images that were supposed to be at the end. 
I also liked this lab because it was the easiest with my partner. We learned how to create animations, the several uses the libraries offered, and how to generate random numbers.
